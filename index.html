			What am I writing on here?
			</h3>

		<div class="content">
			<p>
			I don't consider myself a goal-oriented person, but I like having goals for things that I do. 
			I'm as surprised and confused in writing that sentence as my imagined reader is in reading it. 
			I don't want to think about why those statements can coexist right now (or about which 
			statement is actually a lie), so I'll move past it and talk about what I want out of posting 
			stuff on this blog and how I think that will influence my posting behavior.
			</p>
			<h5>
			The goal
			</h5>
			<p>
			I like writing things down, and sometimes I like the <em>*idea*</em> of people being able to 
			see and read those things. Partially I guess that points back to some kind of hubris, but it 
			feels immodest to point out my own inavoidable sense of pride, so I'll try not to dwell on it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mostly I'm looking to get more comfortable writing for an audience. The whole writing process 
			changes when you know that the end results will be open to outside scrutiny. For one thing, 
			you start feeling like you have to actually <em>finish</em> the project, which generally requires 
			a lot of extra editing and polishing steps. I feel comfortable betting that I've never truly 
			finished any project (writing or otherwise) that I ended up keeping to myself, and I keep most 
			of my projects to myself. As a result, I'm very slow and unsure of myself whenever I have to 
			finish anything. To illustrate, it's taken me 30 minutes or so to figure out how to finish this 
			single paragraph.
			</p>
			<p>
			The goal, then (or main goal out of many less clear sub-goals) is to trick myself into spending 
			more time polishing the stuff I write by making it publicly accessible. The beauty of this is 
			that it's the <em>possibility</em> of scrutiny which accomplishes the goal, not the scrutiny 
			itself.
			</p>
			<h5>
			The beauty of this
			</h5>
			<p>
			There are a few common points of advice for people trying to grow an audience online. I've 
			mostly heard them applied to instagram accounts and youtube channels, but if I had to bet I'd 
			say they probably emerged in the good old golden days of blogging (not actually sure when that 
			was, though, because frankly I didn't participate). "Establish your niche." I don't wanna do 
			that. "Post consistently." I don't wanna do that. "Develop a clear voice." I'm not opposed to 
			doing that, but I'm opposed to worrying about it all that much.
			</p>
			<p>
			I'm once again imagining a reader, and this time I'm imagining them concerned. After all, there's 
			not a massive difference between "how to grow your audience" and "how to keep your current audience 
			happy." I like it when someone whose work I follow online sticks to a clear topic of interest, 
			and I like it when they post regularly. If I spend a lot of time worrying about that stuff, though,
			I won't last 2 months on here. It's just not in the cards for me right now.
			</p>
			<p>
			For all that I've written here about finishing things, this whole project is really about letting 
			things be unfinished for a while. I'm not sure what this blog will look like or read like in a 
			year or in 25 years or in 3 months. I know it's already fulfilling its purpose, though, based on 
			the inordinate amount of time I've spent writing this ~500 word post. That's called polish, baby.

			<h3>
			What I'm Doing Here, My Inspiration, and Some Non-Comprehensive Rules For Myself
			</h3>
			<h4>

		<div class="content">
			<p>
			Land is cheap and plentiful on the internet. This domain name costs $10 a year. I could do 
			blogspot or something for free and then I wouldn't have to write everything in html, but html 
			is easy and I don't want to use blogspot.
			</p>
			<p>
			I got a book for christmas called "Cabin Porn" and there are some people in there 
			who tell their stories about buying cheap real estate and building nice comfy cabins on it. 
			The pictures make it seem like they did a good job. For that reason I'd prefer not to see those 
			people as inspiration for what I'm doing here. In a different book (Blood Meridian) the 
			protagonist rides for days into barren plains and comes across a hermit. Inside the 
			hermit's hut they sit on the mud floor and eat moldy vegetable soup and old meat. I 
			like this comp better because it feels attainable, so it's on my mood board.
			</p>
			<p>
			Here are some rules for myself:
			</p>
			<h5>
			1. don't let (or make) anyone else code this thing for you.
			</h5>
			<p>
			I get a little nervous about this when I remember that I withdrew from the Digital 
			Humanities class I took in 2015 because I missed the first day of javascript, but 
			then I remember that it took my professor about 2 hours to cover all of html. I'd 
			like to keep the CSS to a minimum, but I'm not sure what that even means. I'm not 
			afraid of javascript anymore, I just feel now that it's try-hard and I don't need it.
			</p>
			<p>
			The source is hosted on github and since I don't want to pay for that it has to be a 
			public repo. If you feel strongly about getting involved and making my blog a 
			different color or giving it a tiled background of your face or something then 
			maybe you can branch it and try that out for yourself (I'm pretty sure that's a 
			github thing). Send me the results.
			</p>
			<h5> 
			2. don't use more than one page.
			</h5>
			<p>
			I just don't think a blog needs to have more than one page. I already have an 
			idea for breaking this rule, though, where I use another page for a "dark mode" 
			version. That feels within the spirit of the law, because the content on both 
			pages would be the same. I have a browser extension on my phone to fake a dark 
			mode on sites that don't have one built in (wikipedia is a big one), so if I ever 
			implement this idea it will be for you more than for me.
			</p>
			<h5>
			3. never spend any amount of time thinking about posts I could do to attract readers.
			</h5>
			<p>
			The only reason I can think of to try to attract more readers is to make money, and 
			money makes the internet worse.
			</p>
			<p>
			(Also I've been in the position before of trying to make or write things intended 
			to boost engagement. Frankly it always makes me think less of myself.)
			</p>
			<h5>
			4. never let that stuff you just wrote keep you from making a buck on here.
			</h5>
			<p>
			I believe what I said about how money makes the internet worse, but I also believe 
			in the sour grapes principle. I'll try not to be surprised if I find out the only 
			thing keeping me from embracing all the dirty ad money being passed around the web is 
			the fact that nobody has offered me any.
			</p>
			<h5>
			5. Tone-police yourself relentlessly.
			</h5>
			<p>
			I think "tone-policing" usually refers to being hyper-corrective about the way 
			people talk about sensitive subjects, and that's not what this is about. What this 
			is about is I know who I am as a writer and I don't trust myself not to get real 
			prose-y and cute when I think nobody's watching. "Prose-y and cute" is the tone 
			I'm trying to police against.
			</p>
			<p>
			Alright cool I think I'm done for now.
